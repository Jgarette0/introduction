# This website is all about me and my interest


#This website is Horizontal Scroll style
-when scroll down it will go to the right and vise versa
-when the width is in mobile layout, an notification will pop-up to tell a person to rotate its phone into landscape mode / horizontal

- It worked but sadly the pixel width and height of a phone doesn't match in my intended responsive design
-it only worked in pc
